The origins of the taco are not precisely known, and etymologies for the culinary usage of the word are generally
    theoretical. Taco in the sense of a typical Mexican dish comprising a maize tortilla folded around food is just one
    of the meanings connoted by the word, according to the Real Academia Española, publisher of Diccionario de la Lengua
    Española. This meaning of the pish word "taco" is a Mexican innovation, but the word "taco" is used in other
    contexts to mean "wedge; wad, plug; billiard cue; blowpipe; ramrod; short, stocky person; [or] short, thick piece of
    wood. The etymological origin of this sense of the word is Germanic and has cognates in other European languages,
    including the French word "tache" and the English word -tack. </p>

        <p class="columns"> In Spain, the word "taco" can also be used in the context of tacos de jamón [es]: these are diced pieces of ham, or
            sometimes bits and shavings of ham leftover after a larger piece is sliced.[5] They can be served on their own as
            tapas or street food, or can be added to other dishes such as salmorejo, omelettes, stews, empanadas, or melón con
            jamón.According to one etymological theory, the culinary origin of the term "taco" in Mexico can be traced to its
            employment, among Mexican silver miners, as a term signifying "plug." The miners used explosive charges in plug
            form, consisting of a paper wrapper and gunpowder filling.
            Indigenous origins are also proposed. One possibility is that the word derives from the Nahuatl word "tlahco",
            meaning "half" or "in the middle,"[9] in the sense that food would be placed in the middle of a tortilla.
            Furthermore, dishes analogous to the taco were known to have existed in Pre-Columbian society—for example, the
            Nahuatl word "tlaxcalli" (a type of corn tortilla)</p>

             <summary>  when were  the first tacos sold in the unnited states?
                </summary>
                 <p>jeffery M.putcher , tacos historical proffesor and founderof the university of minnesotta say the earliest mention of tacos in the newspapers in USA ws from 1905 <br>
                    Did you know that Taco Bell’s Founder, Glen Bell, found that “taco” was actually a word that Mexicans didn’t use to describe the meal? Instead, Mexicans used other words to describe tacos that varied by region and local culture.

“Taco” was a word that Mexicans would use toward Americans to identify the dish. This is much like how the Korean food chain Bon Chon calls their “egg rolls” “potstickers” on their mainstream menu but the dish is properly called “mandu” among Koreans.  <br>(source:  <a href="https://wikipedia.com/tacos">wikipedia.com</a>)</p>
